## Goals
This project is about a data pipeline that calculates agricultural assets' carbon risk scores, and thus their likelihoods of being stranded.

It is in a modular format, where each part of the data exploration, ETL pipeline and the report, is generated by a corresponding code file. The user must run only one file:
scripts/run_pipeline.py, as it is the file that connects every step of the pipeline to execute them.

Our main dataset is ![Agriculture Financial Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmer3/agriculture-financial-risk-dataset). This dataset contains:
+ Financial and economic data at enterprise level(i.e. revenue, debt-to-equity ratio)
+ Climate & environmental proxies(average temperature, rainfall, etc.)
+ Structural descriptors(i.e. enterprise size)

## Core Assumptions
Given the limits of the available data, we clarify the following:
+ The dataset is enterprise-level, not investor-level
+ Emissions are proxied, not directly observed
+ Carbon prices are scenario-based, not forecasted
+ Our goal is a climate-financial risk pipeline, not precise emissions accounting
