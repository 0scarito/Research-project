Team: Oscar, Daniil, Oulaya, Ulysse

## Goals
This project is about a data pipeline that calculates agricultural assets' carbon risk scores, and thus their likelihoods of being stranded.


For now, the main file is in .ipynb format. But in the future, we will change it to a series of .py files, with the main.py file being the main access point.

Our initial datasets are .. and (TRACE Emissions Dataset)[https://climatetrace.org/data]. 
For TRACE dataset, we have taken "Agriculture" sector CO2-equivalent emission within the last 100 years.
